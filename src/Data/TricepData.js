Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps to better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there is a 90 degree angle formed between the upper arm and forearm.","Then, exhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to bring your body back to the starting position.","Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions."],

This will be your starting position.","Keeping the upper arms stationary, lower the bar by allowing the elbows to flex. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.

Your elbows should be in close to your head and the arms should be perpendicular to the floor with the knuckles aimed at the ceiling. This will be your starting position.","Slowly lower the rope behind your head as you hold the upper arms stationary.

The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the rope with the palms facing each other. This is your starting position.","Using the triceps, bring the rope down as you bring each side of the rope to the side of your thighs. At the end of the movement the arms are fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement.","After holding for a second, at the contracted position, bring the rope slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step.","Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."],

Slowly use both hands to grab the dumbbell and lift it over your head until both arms are fully extended.","The resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hands should be facing up towards the ceiling. This will be your starting position.","Keeping your upper arms close to your head with elbows in and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.","Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell.

Tip: Make sure that - as opposed to a regular bench press - you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement.","After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.","Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.","When you are done, place the bar back in the rack."],
