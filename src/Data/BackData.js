        Name: "Lat Pulldowns",
        Group: "back",

        Name: "Rows",
        Group: "back",
        Description: "Pull the handle and weight back toward the lower abdomen while trying not to use the momentum of the row too much by moving the torso backward with the arms. Target the middle to upper back by keeping your back straight and squeezing your shoulder blades together as you row, chest out. Return the handle forward under tension to full stretch, remembering to keep that back straight even though flexed at the hips. Repeat the exercise for the desired number of repetitions.",

    {
        Name: "Dumbbell Rows",
        Group: "back",
        Description: "Take one step back into a lunge position. Keep the front leg bent with the knee in line with ankle, and keep the back leg straight. Lean slightly forward, and rest your free hand on your forward thigh. Tighten your core by squeezing your belly button in towards your spine. Lower the dumbbell toward the floor until you have a full extension at the elbow. Maintain proper posture through your shoulders, hips, and lower back. Avoid rounding or arching the lumbar spine. Begin the upward motion of the dumbbell by first sliding your shoulder blade toward your spine and then lifting the weight up toward your torso by driving your elbow to the ceiling. Keep your elbow close to your body as it passes the ribs. Squeeze your shoulder blade in toward the center of back (contracting the rhomboids). At the end of the movement, the dumbbell should be in line with your chest and your elbow should be pointing up toward the ceiling. Be sure to maintain good posture through spine, shoulders, and hips. Repeat for the appropriate number of repetitions. Switch sides and repeat the same number of repetitions with the opposite arm.",

        Name: "Rowing Maching",

        Name: "Pull-Ups",
        Group: "back",
        Description: "Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar. After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.",

        Name: "Chin-Ups",
        Group: "back",
        Description: "Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing your torso and a grip closer than the shoulder width. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, keep your torso as straight as possible while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. Tip: Keeping the torso as straight as possible maximizes biceps stimulation while minimizing back involvement. As you breathe out, pull your torso up until your head is around the level of the pull-up bar. Concentrate on using the biceps muscles in order to perform the movement. Keep the elbows close to your body. Tip: The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar. After a second of squeezing the biceps in the contracted position, slowly lower your torso back to the starting position; when your arms are fully extended. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.",

    {
        Name: "Rack-Pulls",
        Group: "back",
        Description: "Set up in a power rack with the bar on the pins. The pins should be set to the desired point; just below the knees, just above, or in the mid thigh position. Position yourself against the bar in proper deadlifting position. Your feet should be under your hips, your grip shoulder width, back arched, and hips back to engage the hamstrings. Since the weight is typically heavy, you may use a mixed grip, a hook grip, or use straps to aid in holding the weight. With your head looking forward, extend through the hips and knees, pulling the weight up and back until lockout. Be sure to pull your shoulders back as you complete the movement. Return the weight to the pins and repeat.",

        Name: "Standing Cable Reverse Fly",
        Group: "back",
        Description: "Adjust the pulleys to the appropriate height and adjust the weight. The pulleys should be above your head. Grab the left pulley with your right hand and the right pulley with your left hand, crossing them in front of you. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement by moving your arms back and outward, keeping your arms straight as you execute the movement. Pause at the end of the motion before returning the handles to the start position.",
