## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/sheldoncoates/Workout-Randomizer)

This project was made to keep everyones workout fresh and new everytime they go to the gym. It also was meant to alleviate the stress of having to memorize workouts/ exercises.

### Built With
Here is the tech I used to put together this app.
* [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
